	  This driver adds support for the 2K chips connected to
	  the "platform bus" (Linux abstraction for directly to the
	  processor attached devices).  Which can be found on various
	  boards from Phytec (http://www.phytec.de) like the PCM027,
	  PCM038. It also provides the OpenFirmware "platform bus" found
	  on embedded systems with OpenFirmware bindings, e.g. if you
	  have a PowerPC based system you may want to enable this option.
